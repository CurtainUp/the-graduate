# Integration Testing

Tests typically written after the functional code is written. These tests are to ensure that if someone makes any changes to code, your functionality wonâ€™t break. For example, if you require certain fields to be completed on a POST and someone were to remove a field, the test would fail, so the developer would know that field is necessary.
