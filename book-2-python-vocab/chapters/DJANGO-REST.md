# Django REST Framework
Data is rendered into JSON and returned to the client (you could use Postman or the Browsable API as a “client”) rather than data sent as context through the view to the template and then serve HTML representations to the browser

**Serializers**
* “Translators” to take data in one form to convert to a different form
Looks like forms class!

**Viewsets**
* Similar to views - business logic goes here 

**Router**
* Helper on top of URLs file - can configure routes slightly differently

**Browsable API**
* Web application to open our Django REST app to look at and interact with our JSON data - woot!
