# API (Application Programming Interface)
You built a JSON based API using json-server - woot! But you couldnâ€™t really set any restrictions beyond CRUD on that API. A traditional API allows businesses to share their data so people can use their data to create different apps. Beyond that, you can add all sorts of logic to your API so that users can get different responses based on their requests.
