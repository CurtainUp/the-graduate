# Software Development / Computer Science-y Terms and Concepts

This section covers common questions that NSS grads get asked in interviews. Is it great these questions are asked in interviews for junior dev positions? *_No_*. But, companies are lazy with interviewing so they come up with these types of questions to pad the interview and make sure it seems like they are doing their job of sufficiently interviewing for a dev position. 

Whenever possible, when asked these questions, give a simple definition and then an example of it in use (like an example from a time you used the concept in a group or individual project or something); this is a great way to show you understand the concept in practice, rather than just regurgitating a Websterâ€™s dictionary definition.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP):
The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

1. [Abstraction](./chapters/ABSTRACTION.md)
1. [Inheritance](./chapters/INHERITANCE.md)
1. [Polymorphism](./chapters/POLYMORPHISM.md)
1. [Idempotency](./chapters/IDEMPOTENCY.md)
