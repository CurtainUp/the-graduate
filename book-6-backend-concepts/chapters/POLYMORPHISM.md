# Polymorphism

[C# Polymorphism](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/polymorphism)

A way to use a class exactly like its parent so thereâ€™s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are. This typically happens by defining a (parent) interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods. Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods.

There are 2 types of polymorphism: class based and method based.

Method based:

You can use the same method on different types.

Python: 
```python
# len() being used for a string 
print(len("geeks")) 

# len() being used for a list 
print(len([10, 20, 30])) 
```

Class based: 
Below code shows how Python can use two different class types, in the same way. We create a for loop that iterates through a tuple of objects. Then call the methods without being concerned about which class type each object is. We assume that these methods actually exist in each class.
```python
class India(): 
	def capital(self): 
		print("New Delhi is the capital of India.") 

	def language(self): 
		print("Hindi the primary language of India.") 

class USA(): 
	def capital(self): 
		print("Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.") 

	def language(self): 
		print("English is the primary language of USA.") 

obj_ind = India() 
obj_usa = USA() 
for country in (obj_ind, obj_usa): 
	country.capital() 
	country.language() 
```
