# Idempotency
Basically, watch this [4 minute video](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/idempotency.html) ;)

The above examples show that GET implies getting the entity you request. It is idempotent which means youâ€™ll receive identical data when performing the same request each time you visit that resource.

Every time you go to `localhost:8000/products/1` you will always get the product data related to the product with id=1

The POST request is not idempotent, which means that if you send the same data in the repeat request, it will create an entity duplicate but with a different identifier (primary key).

If you post a new product to `localhost:8000/products` and then post that exact same data again, it will not return the exact same thing because the id will be different. 
```cs
// first time you post hat
{
  id: 1, 
  name: hat
}
// second time you post hat
{
  id: 2, 
  name: hat
}
```
